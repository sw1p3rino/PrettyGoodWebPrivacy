This is a browser extension currently usable in crome which decrypts pgp messages on all websites if the private key you give it fits.

Feel free to security audit the software, it is still in an early stage and likely has some issues.
FYI, Privakeys are currently stored unencryted or together with the passphrase so you better be careful which key you put into the software.

The above issues will be fixed in future releases, additionally encryption will be added as well in order to enable faster communication.

The project was inspired by FlowCrypt (https://flowcrypt.com/) as I thought to myself that there has to be a way to generalize this.
If you find websites where it doesnt work, create an issue and i check if i can fix it.

Have fun :)
